Hi! My name is Luke Attard, I am currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Kansas School of Engineering. I graduated with a degree in Interdisciplinary Computer Science. I am interested in backend development, software security, and machine learning. I am currently conducting research for the Architectural Engineering Department of KU in which we aim to make the process of infrastructure inspection more efficient through the use of machine learning and augmented reality tools such as Yolo image recognition models and the Hololens2 mixed reality headset.
